    <h2>About the dish:</h2>

    <p>
    The real secret here is making sure you sear the meat before the long, slow braising. Serve with mashed potatoes. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) bone-in beef pot roast. </li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to tast. </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed. </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil. </li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms. </li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped. </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced. </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter. </li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour. </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste. </li>
        <li>2 ½ cups chicken broth. </li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, cut into chunks. </li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into chunks. </li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary. </li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Generously season both sides of roast with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over the top until well coated, and pat it into the meat. Shake off any excess. </li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sear the roast on both sides for 5-6 minutes each, until well browned. Remove from the skillet and set aside. </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and stir in mushrooms and butter; cook for 3-4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in onion; cook for 5 minutes, until onions are translucent and begin to brown. Add garlic, stir for about a minute. </li>
        <li>Stir in 1 1/2 tablespoons flour; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add tomato paste, and cook for another minute. </li>
        <li>Slowly add chicken stock, stir to combine, and return to a simmer. Remove skillet from the heat. </li>
        <li>Place carrots and celery in the slow cooker. Place roast over the vegetables and pour in any accumulated juices. Add rosemary and thyme. </li>
        <li>Pour onion and mushroom mixture over the top of the roast. Cover slow cooker, turn to high and cook the roast for 5-6 hours, until the meat is fork tender. </li>
        <li>Skim off any fat from the surface and remove the bones. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
    </ol>
